# Project-4-Multidisease-prediction
Multi disease Prediction
🧠 Multi Disease Prediction System
A machine learning–based web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases based on user-provided health parameters. This project is designed to demonstrate the practical application of data science and machine learning in healthcare.
📌 Project Overview
The Multi Disease Prediction System helps users assess the risk of common diseases using trained machine learning models. By entering basic medical and lifestyle details, users can receive instant predictions that may support early awareness and preventive care.
